        <h2>💻 Technical Skills</h2>
        <p>I have developed a strong foundation in web development, focusing on building responsive, user-friendly, and efficient applications. My technical skill set includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I use to design structured layouts, style modern interfaces, and add interactivity to web pages. I also have hands-on experience with React, enabling me to create component-based front-end applications with improved performance and maintainability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 & CSS3</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>Git & GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>⚙️ Development Tools & Practices</h2>
        <p>I regularly use Git and GitHub for version control, which helps me track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain clean code repositories. I am comfortable working with Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment and follow best practices such as proper file structuring, reusable components, and meaningful code documentation.I have experience debugging applications, testing functionality, and optimizing performance to ensure smooth user experiences across devices and browsers.</p>
        <h2>🚀 Project & Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>Through academic and personal projects, I have gained practical experience in full-stack development. I have built web applications such as a Food Ordering Website, a CRM Dashboard, where I implemented features like user interfaces,logics, and integration.
        I actively enhance my skills by participating in internships, online courses, and hands-on project development. I am continuously learning new technologies and frameworks to stay aligned with industry standards.</p>
